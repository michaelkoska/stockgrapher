# stockgrapher

This is a basic git project for a portfolio using D3. While I will continue adding new features, everything should work with the index.ejs (can be switched to an html file), the styles.css, graphfunctions.js files. This is not styled or responsive at the moment. Style will likely be minimum throughout the project, but responsive features will be added. The main purpose of this project is to grab and display data.

The app takes input values and sends an API request to Alpha Vantage and then displays the minimum and maximum closing prices of the graph. As of now, there is no "x" or "y" labels, but these should be added soon. For now, 0 is calculated to represent the lowest closing price of the data. I will likely add the labels and values using SVG text.

The next features added should be:
1) X and Y labels and values
2) Responsive features
3) Possibly styles

More features in the distant future
1) Displaying recent stocks
2) Comparing stocks side-by-side
3) More data viewing options
